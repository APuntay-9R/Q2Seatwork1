					<td>"Powder" Jinx</td>
					<td>Zaun</td>
					<td>Jinx is an anarchic and unpredictable character driven by chaos and destruction. Once known as Powder, she was a sweet but fragile child who shared a close bond with her sister, Vi, in the undercity of Piltover. However, after a series of tragic events that fractured her relationship with Vi and the loss of her family, Jinx descended into madness. Embracing anarchy, she now wreaks havoc across Piltover and Zaun with explosive weaponry and manic energy. Her personality is erratic, often gleeful in the face of destruction, and she thrives on creating chaos without concern for the consequences, seeing the world as a playground for her chaotic impulses.</td>

					<td>"Violet" Vi</td>
					<td>Piltover</td>
					<td>Vi, short for Violet, is a tough, no-nonsense enforcer from the undercity of Zaun. Once a street thug with a rough upbringing, Vi’s life took a turn when she was recruited by Caitlyn to serve as a police officer in Piltover, becoming a member of the Enforcer unit. Despite her tough exterior, Vi has a deep sense of justice and a strong protective instinct, especially for her sister, Jinx. Although the two sisters are estranged due to tragic circumstances, Vi still holds onto the hope of finding Jinx and reconnecting with her. Vi is known for her brawler fighting style, using her powerful gauntlets to deal devastating blows, making her both a fierce ally and a fearsome adversary.</td>

					<td>Piltover</td>
					<td>Caitlyn, the "Sheriff of Piltover," is a disciplined and highly intelligent officer dedicated to maintaining law and order in her city. Raised in a wealthy family, Caitlyn is well-educated and skilled in investigation, which makes her an excellent detective. Her partnership with Vi, a more instinctive and streetwise counterpart, is effective in solving crimes and maintaining peace in Piltover. Caitlyn is driven by a strong moral compass, and her pursuit of justice is unrelenting, especially when it comes to stopping criminal activities and dealing with threats from Zaun. While she's calm and collected, Caitlyn is also determined, and she often acts as the voice of reason within her team.</td>

					<td>Heimerdinger</td>
					<td>Neutral</td>
					<td>Heimerdinger, the brilliant yordle scientist, is one of Piltover’s foremost inventors and thinkers. Known for his exceptional intellect, Heimerdinger is a revered figure in the scientific community. Despite his diminutive size, he has contributed greatly to the development of technology and innovation in Piltover, always seeking to use his inventions for the betterment of society. However, Heimerdinger’s cautious and sometimes conservative nature often puts him at odds with more reckless or impulsive individuals, particularly in matters of progress and experimentation. His sense of responsibility for the consequences of his inventions makes him a careful, yet sometimes overly cautious, figure in the face of rapid technological advancement.</td>

					<td>Ekko</td>
					<td>Zaun</td>
					<td>Ekko is a brilliant young inventor from the undercity of Zaun. Growing up in the dangerous, chaotic environment of Zaun, Ekko developed a deep understanding of technology, creating a device known as the Z-Drive, which grants him the ability to manipulate time itself. Ekko’s intelligence and creativity make him a prodigy, but his past is filled with loss, including the death of his close friend, which drives much of his actions. He is a visionary who dreams of a better world, and he seeks to change the oppressive systems that govern Zaun and Piltover. Though he’s young, Ekko is a fierce protector of his community, and he leads a group of rebellious youth known as the “Firelights.” His quest for justice and the ability to right past wrongs makes him a compelling and determined figure.</td>
